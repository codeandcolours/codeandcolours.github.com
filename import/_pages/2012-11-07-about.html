<h3>Jelmer who?</h3>
<p>I am Jelmer de Maat, an <a title="My other website" href="http://jelmerdemaat.nl" target="_blank">Industrial Design student</a> as well as a (front-end) developer. On this blog I ramble mostly about new CSS stuff and my ideas on how <em>the web</em> should <em>evolve</em>. Feel free to contact me via <a href="http://twitter.com/jelmerdemaat" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. You can also find me on <a href="https://github.com/jelmerdemaat" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p><small>Be warned! Blog may contain contrasting opinions and innovative ideas.</small></p>
<h3>You call this a website?</h3>
<p>I know, it's not very elaborate. I got tired of not being able to share my front-end-thoughts in a dedicated place, so I built this blog in one day, just to have a place to stay. When I have more time to design things around here, it will get spicier.</p>
<h3>Why the name Code and Colours?</h3>
<p>Because I like code, and colours. In the future the blog could also include some graphic design tips. And, I like the word <em>colours</em> better than <em>colors</em>. It adds some character.</p>
