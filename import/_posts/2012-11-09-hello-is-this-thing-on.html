<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>This is the first of (hopefully) many posts that are going to be published on this piece of internet. I have finally <a title="About" href="http://code.jelmerdemaat.nl/about/">taken some time to create a blog-thing</a> of my own, and even though it is small, it will serve its purpose for the coming months or so.</p>

<p>What you can expect here is mostly my experiments with and general thoughts on front-end development, meaning, CSS, HTML and JavaScript. The posts will be about techniques, browsers, developments of web technologies and other nerd stuff. I hope I can contribute to the discussions out there.</p>
<p>I have gathered some fun ideas for posts and experiments in the past months, so expect to have some good reading time here!</p>
<p>See you here in the near future!</p>
<p><em>Jelmer</em></p>
