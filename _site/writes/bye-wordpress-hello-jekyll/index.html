	<h1>Bye Wordpress, hello Jekyll.</h1>
	<p>Wordpress is nice as a blogging platform, hell, even as a CMS. It's super user-friendly compared to literally all other CMS's or blogging platforms I've seen. But, it's also just a tad too much for a small blog like this.</p>




<p>Realistically, I don't need the media page, links, themes, plugins or users that the system provides. One could strip these away, or, one can take much less effort and embrace another blogging platform. Because of the technical nature of myself and of my writings, I chose to learn static blogging with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>.</p>




<p>I am everything but savvy with command line tools, Git and deployment, but hey, let's just start and see where it will end. I've looked into the possibilities of Jekyll and it's actually very powerful, though one thing that I would need to find out is how to provide the feature of posting comments. More news on that, later.</p>




<p>The Jekyll blog will be hosted on GitHub at the custom URLÂ <a href="http://codeandcolours.com" target="_blank">codeandcolours.com</a>. I have also disabled comments on this Wordpress blog, because of the huge amounts of spam (another reason to look for another commenting system) and this move to Jekyll in the near future. If possible, I will write a piece about the move ("From Wordpress to Jekyll") to teach everybody as nooby as myself how to do this kind of stuff.</p>


<p>Cheers, and see you at the other side!</p>
